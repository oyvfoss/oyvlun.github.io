Anaconda
;;;;;;;;

Package manager for python. Everything (python version and all additional software) is stored in the Anaconda folder. Easy to install and keep track of software, and easy to switch between python versions.

Package installation only works for software that has been packaged for Anaconda, so may not be available for more obscure things. In this case, normal installation procedures (e.g. *pip install* or installing from source) can be used.
