Princeton Ocean Model
:::::::::::::::::::::

Introductory notes from Glen: 

**compile_test** 

Has configurations and parameters overriding the ones in
*defalt_params*. Any parameter in *default_params* can be set in
*compile_test*. The grid size parameters under "Array sizes" *must* be
set. *im* is x-grid, *jm* y-grid and *kb* sigma levels. Horizontal
velocities are computed at points between *w*-points. So if you want
100 layers of horizontal velocity, kb needs to be 101.

In principle, these steps should get me a long way:

- **source complile_test**: Runs the commands in compile_test,
  builds a bunch of *.o* and other files based on the
  parameters.
- **make**: Compiles code with the compile specified in the makefile. 
- **run ./pom2kt**: Runs the model.

Newer versions of the model can deal with circular BCs. 

Glen has horizontally uniform stratification. He gives one profile,
which is interpolated onto the corresponding sigma levels at ech
grid. I want a horizontally varying stratification, but at least to
begin woith I want a flat bottom, so I won't need all the interpolation.
