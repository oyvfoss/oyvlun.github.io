Memory issues
=============

I've had troubles with the *var* directory filling up, making it impossible to print amomng other things. Most of this stuff is in */var/cache*.

*Cache* is memory which can be accessed quickly. Acertain partition of the harddisk is used for this purpose. 

It is a bad idea to clean out these files completely. Use this command instead:

::

 sudo apt-get autoclean

Doing this seems to have cleaned up the */var/apt/* directory to a tolerable level. At least printing seems fine now.
