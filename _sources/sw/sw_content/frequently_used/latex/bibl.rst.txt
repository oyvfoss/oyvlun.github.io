Bibliographies
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Spent quite some time looking at this without really understanding what's going on. The documentation for this stuff is all over the place. This seems to work for Zotero-exported bibliographies, using *natbib* to give a reasonable format:

::

   \documentclass{article} 

   \usepackage{natbib}
   \bibliographystyle{unsrtnat}

   \begin{document}
   
   ..it has been said that "wings are to a bird like arms are to a 
   man, except men can't fly and birds can't use forks" 
   (\cite{young_propagation_1997})...


   \bibliography{-name of .bib file-}
   \end{document}

`This <http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php>`_ looks like a good natbib reference sheet. I haven't looked at it in detail.


Nice links for natbib `citation  <https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Natbib_citation_styles>`_ and  `bibliography  <https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Natbib_bibliography_styles>`_ styles.


For exporting Zotero bibtex bibliography I use the Better Bibtex Zotero extension, which lets you control the export format including the citekey.
