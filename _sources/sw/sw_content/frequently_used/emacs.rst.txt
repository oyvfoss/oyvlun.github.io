Emacs
=====
.. admonition:: Basic commands:

    **Ctrl+v**: Forward one screen.

    **Alt+v**: Back one screen.

    **Ctrl+>**: Go to end of document.

    **Ctrl+<**: Go beginning of document.

    **Ctrl+S** *(text)* **return**: Search document. Press return again to go to
    next.

    **Ctrl+(x-s)**: Save.

    **Ctrl+(x-c)**: Exit.





**Buffers**

A buffer is a "window" displaying information. Usually, one stays in
the editor buffer. However, sometimes one might want to do something
in another buffer. This other buffer then occupies the current emacs
window. Switching between buffers is done most easily by *C - x +
<left/right arrow>*.


**Bookmarks**

Easiest (among many!) implementation of the possibility of going back
to a specific location in a long document without scrolling. Bookmarks
have the advantage of being preserved between sessions.

**Set bookmark** (Execute with the marker at the desired potition)

::

 C-x r m <name> 

**Jump to bookmark** 

::

 C-x r b <name>

**List all bookmarks** 

::

 C-x r l  

**Macros**

Not the same as shortcuts/hotkeys, which are more permanent.

**Defining macros**

::
 
 <f3> + (macro) + <f4>

or:

::

 C-x + ( + (macro) + C-x )


**Executing macros**

::

   <f4> + (macro)

or:

::

 C-x e + (macro)



**Shortcuts**

Open the file */home/oyvindl/.emacs*. To connect the key *f6* to printing the string *string here*, insert the following line:

::

 (global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") '"string here")

*kbd "<f6>"* can be replaced by other keys/combinations like *kbd "M-a"* (alt+a). 
To see current key setup, type *<f1+k>* in emacs. This will prompt an input of a command, and give the current response to that input, if there is one.
