  **hg log** - Version overview.

  **hg status** - Shows new files in the directory.

  **hg add** - Include these files.

  **hg commit -m 'Comment'** - Commit changes.

  **hg push** - Sync outwards.

  **hgview** - View change history.

**Working over SSH**

In my current setup, I want to push to a (basically passive) directory
on the frinkiac/moli servers. The former is the trickiest, since I'm
doing it over ssh.

**Setting up**

::
  hg clone locdir ssh://frink[..].edu/remdir

Note that *remdir* is specified relative to my user directory on the server.

This creates a copy of the repository on the remote server. To build
the changeset, run *hg update* on the server.

Changes on the wor machine can be propagated to the server by:

::
  hg push ssh://frink[..].edu/remdir

Alternatively, the depault location can be specified in *.hg/hgrc*. Then
*hg push* does the same thing.

So: After changing anything on the active machine:

    - Add and commit changeset locally.
    - *hg push* to server.
    - hg update on server.

To propagate changes *from* the server to the work machine:

    - Add and commit on server.
    - *hg pull* from work machine.
    - hg update on work machine.

This is, of course, assuming that nothing needs to be merged, which should
be the case as long as I keep syncing often enough.
