Python modules/packages
=======================

`This <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html>`_ is nice.

Modules are *.py* files, typically scripts with a bunch of defined functions.

The PYTHONPATH
''''''''''''''

Default location where Python looks for modules. Display by *print
sys.path*.

Packages
''''''''

Modules are organized in packeges and subpackages. Examples of
packages are *pycurrents* or *oyv*. Examples of subpackages are
*pycurrents.num* or *oyv.plots*. 

This structure mirrors the directory structure. Subpackages are
subfolders within the package directory. 

*Note*: Each package/subpackage folder needs an *__init__.py* file to
be recogonized by Python as a package. This file can be empty, or it
can contain stuff which is preloaded when the package is imported.
