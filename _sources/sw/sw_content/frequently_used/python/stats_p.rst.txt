Statistical tools

**import scipy.stats as ss**...


The documentation for this package is consequently incredibly cryptic, while the functions are fairly simple. Each distribution type has *shape* and *loc* parameters which typically are i.e. the mean and deviation.

Fitting data to a distribution
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


*Example: Rayleigh fitting of data x,y:*



**fitparams = ss.rayleigh.fit(y)**

Returns a tuple *fitparams = (shape,loc)*.

**yfit = ss.rayleigh.pdf(x,shape=fitparams[0],loc=fitparams[1])**

Creates an array *yfit* at the points *x* corresponding to the Rayleigh probability density function with the extracted parameters.
