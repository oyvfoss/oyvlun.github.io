Saving/loading variables
::::::::::::::::::::::::

Fairly easy to use *pickle*. Doesn't seem to work for dictionaries or lists for some reason (look into this), but ok for arrays.

Save:
::
 
 import pickle
 outfile = open('file.p','wb')
 pickle.dump(array, outfile)
 
Load:
::

 infile = open('file.p','rb')
 data = pickle.load(infile)
