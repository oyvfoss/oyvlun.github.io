**The physical environment of an Antarctic Fjord: Andvord Bay, western Antarctic Peninsula**

The western Antarctic Peninsula is lined with glacio-marine fjords which connect
the coastal ocean with the terrestrial ice sheet. The physical oceanography of
these fjords is relatively unexplored despite their potential importance for
tidewater glaciers, for the broader coastal ocean, and for productive marine
ecosystems present within the fjords. The topic of this seminar talk is Andvord
Bay, a fjord located in the Gerlache Strait on the north-western Peninsula.
Comprehensive oceanographic observations from shipboard surveys and moorings
are used to characterize the fjord environment. Since Andvord
Bay is located just north of the current influence of warm shelf water masses,
the fjord glaciers are not currently in retreat, and glacial inputs are
dominated by solid ice. Meltwater runoff, mean winds, tidal currents and mixing
are all weak inside the fjord, in contrast to the more energetic environment
outside. The lack of a strong mean circulation provides beneficial conditions
for phytoplankton blooms, and partially isolates the fjord from temperature
variations observed in the outside ocean. While background exchange flow is
weak, occasional katabatic wind episodes effectively flush the upper layer of
the fjord ocean.
