Remaking SIC
''''''''''''

Previously only NaNs (was using the *interp2d* functions and there were NaNs in
the source array). Later figured out that interpolating with this function was
yielding weird results (SIC > 105%, etc.). Now instead using the
*scipy.interpolate.griddata* function, which seems to perform well. 

**Notes on interpolating:**
For python intepolation: `This
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49185127/unexpected-results-when-using-scipy-interpolate-griddata>`_:
may be the way to go, actually:
::

 To get bilinear interpolation of unstructured data with SciPy, 
 use SmoothBivariateSpline with kx=1 and ky=1 (bilinear), and 
 s=0 (no smoothing). (But it seems you'll need more data points 
 than in this example to achieve s=0.)


May want to eventually look into `GMT (Generic Mapping Tools)
<http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/doc/5.4.5/pdf/GMT_Tutorial.pdf>`_ for interpolation
and other grid operations. Looks well-documented and seems like it would be easy
to apply in UNIX shell..


Combining time series
'''''''''''''''''''''

Code for combining the time series in a single Bunch in
*atwain/code/processinganddata/combine_time_series.py*.

Included metadata in the Bunch, and dowumented in the ATWAIN pdf. 

Resulting file (1-d running averages) in *atwain/data/combined_timeseries.p*.

Updated, reorganized, inserted figures etc.


Current section
'''''''''''''''

For panel plot: Wanted to detide. *oyv.tides.tidefit_ts_1d* ran into troubel when there
are completely masked rows. Fixed this.


Seminar abstract
----------------

Created an abstract roughly based on previous stuff. Idea: Use Ziegler and Eidam
to *support* the claims, without going into detail.
