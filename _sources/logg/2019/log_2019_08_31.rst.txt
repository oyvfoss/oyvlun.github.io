A-TWAIN currents
''''''''''''''''

Rough processing to get to a time series I can use. Details documented in 1.1.2.
in the (current) ATWAIN document. 

- *final_clean_and_split_ncfiles.py*: Applied thresholds to remove weird edge
  effects and separate deployments (1) and (2,3). 
- *make_depth_average_currents*: Computed depth average currents and saved as
  pickles (*depth_avg_currents_2013_2017.p*,
  *depth_avg_currents_2013_2017_int.p*). The latter interpolated onto 15 min grid.
  Looks reasonable - use for now.
