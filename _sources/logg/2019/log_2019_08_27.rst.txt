Answered a bunch of e-mails received after sending my new contact e-mail..

Oceanography lunch
''''''''''''''''''

Good to do about every second week, in *Polheim*, preferably on weeks where
there is no seminar. People can bring lunch etc.
Should be an *ocean@npolar.no* addres, or something like that.

SST
'''

Re-downloaded - now interpolating using *interp2d* (which I confirmed just comes
down to bilinear interpolation).

Comparing my SST with the SST which was already in the data folder:
*code/processing_and_data/sst/compare_sst_extracted.py*.

**ATWAIN**

- Sea Ice cover: Interpolate onto exact point to produce time series.
- Grab SST from *the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Tem-
  perature product (OISST v2, available from NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSD, Boulder, Colorado, USA, at
  https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/; Reynolds et al., 2007; Reynolds, 2009)*.
  Interpolate onto exact point (note: this might already be included, but
  probably just as well to do it myself for consistency.. 
- Temperature: Create "heat time series" by combining with SST. Also include the
  middle sensor for the first deployment, for comparison..
- Currents: Short comparative analysis of the deployments:
    - Spectra.
    - Mean flow.
- Use the latter to define the dominant direction. Rotate each ccordingly and
  rerun the script to join the current time series. 
- Find the depth range where u and Q can both be computed, and compute a heat
  flux field.
- If this looks pretty uniform (it should): Do a vertical integral to get a 1d
  time series.
