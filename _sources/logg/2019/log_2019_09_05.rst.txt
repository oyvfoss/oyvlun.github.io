Sea ice drift products
''''''''''''''''''''''

There is a very nice description of the various products in `Ricker et al (2018)
<https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/48617/>`_.


Projection issues
'''''''''''''''''

managed to -once again- confuse myself entirely when trying to figure out 

Grid tools
''''''''''

Probably need to find consistent, trustable ways of doing grid
transformation/interpolation etc. Tried installing `xESMF
<https://xesmf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, but the installation hangs in
conda and I don't want to risk any scary conflict issues which may cause other
problems. Skipping.

For reprojecting between grid and geo coordinates, what I need is something like
a *bearing angle* for the grid. Found `this stackoverflow question
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54873868/python-calculate-bearing-between-two-lat-long>`_
informative. It looks like *seapy.earth_angle* computed the angle i want,
although it doesn't look like there is an easy implemention for a whole grid field.

**Ok:**

Struggling with installation of packages in conda. Trying with a **new
environment: GRIDENV **. Here, I have installed pyngl, xesmf and other gridding
tools.

Successful interpolation
''''''''''''''''''''''''

*processing_and_data/sea_ice_drift/test_reprojection.py*: Test of reprojection of sea ice drift data onto new
array. A little clunky, but a lot more efficient than what I have been doing before.
