Motivation: How/when/why does atlantic water make it into the Arctic Ocean?

Investigating water mass pathways in the eastern Fram Strait, by far the main
path for AW into the Arctic. This main pathway goes across the Yermak Plateau.

Using an ocean/sea-ice model and looking at tracer distributions.

Identified 4 main pathways:

- **Recirculation**: Flow deflects to the east - water ends up along the coast of
  Greenland and never makes it into the Arctic Ocean.

- **Outer Yermak Branch**: Flow along the outer contour of the Yermak Plateau.

- **Yermak Pass Branch**: Flow through a slightl depression in the bathymetry at
  the souther base of the Yermak Plateau.

- **Svalbard Branch**: Flow close to the coast of Spitsbergen, inward of the
  main continental slope.
