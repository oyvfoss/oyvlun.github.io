Motivation: How/when/why does atlantic water make it into the Arctic Ocean?

Investigating water mass pathways in the eastern Fram Strait, by far the main
path for AW into the Arctic. This main pathway goes across the Yermak Plateau.

Using an ocean/sea-ice model and looking at tracer distributions.

Identified 4 main pathways:

- **Recirculation**: Flow deflects to the east - water ends up along the coast of
  Greenland and never makes it into the Arctic Ocean.

- **Outer Yermak Branch**: Flow along the outer contour of the Yermak Plateau.

- **Yermak Pass Branch**: Flow through a slightl depression in the bathymetry at
  the souther base of the Yermak Plateau.

- **Svalbard Branch**: Flow close to the coast of Spitsbergen, inward of the
  main continental slope.

Size and time dependence

Winter flow mainly through the Recirculation (particularly in spring) and Yermak
Pass (particularily in December) Branches.

Svalbard Branch mainly a factor in summer.

Outer Yermak brenach always pretty small.

Dynamics

The West Spitsbergen Current (WSC) does not *split*, it tends to go *either* to
the Recirculation or Yermak Pass branches. The deciding factor seems to be the
PV field. Dusing some conditions, there is a strong increase
in PV west of the WSC. This prevents flow in the recirculation pathway, and
rather forces flow into the Yermak Pass.
