Arctic Oscillation

.. admonition:: Typical definition

  **The first EOF of the mean sea level pressure field in
  the Northern Hemisphere.**
 

Also: **Northern Annular mode**.

My understanding *(could be wrong!)*:

**Negative phase:** Weaker and more unstable `polar vortex <./polar_vortex.html>`_, therefore increased meridional
mass and heat transport. As a result: *warmer Arctic, cooler mid-latitudes,
increased storminess in the Midwest..*.

**Positive phase:** Stronger and more stable polar vortex with less heat transport towards the
pole. Therefore: colder Arctic.

Relation to sea ice
+++++++++++++++++++


Negative AO favors a clockwise atmospheric circulation direction. This acts to
keep more older, thicker ice within the central Arctic Ocean.

Positive AO tends to push sea ice out of the Fram Strait, so that the central
ice is thinner and melts more easily during summer.
