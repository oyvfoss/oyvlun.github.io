Sea ice drift

Products
++++++++

NSIDC
'''''

Sea ice drift estimates were obtained from the NSIDC Polar Pathfinder Daily 25
km EASE-Grid Sea Ice Motion Vectors product (obtained from from
https://daacdata.apps.nsidc.org/pub/DATASETS/nsidc0116\_icemotion\_vectors\_v4/, hf. referred to as
*NSIDC*). The data is available on the 25x25 km EASE grid, and ice drift
velocity vectors are by default separated into components in the local grid
direction, making the calculation of drift into a grid cell relatively simple. 


Ifremer
'''''''

Sea-ice drift was also obtained from the Ifremer-CERSAT merged sea-ice product
obtained from
*ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/cersat/products/gridded/psi-drift*
hf. referred to as *Ifremer*. We use the merged ASCAT (A-B) SSMI product,
and look at 3-day averaged fields where missing values have been filled (by
drift inferred from wind data?).

This product is available on a 62.5 x 62.5 km polar stereographic grid, and
drift vectors are presented in terms of geographic coordinates (zonal and
meridional velocity components). 


Boundary box
++++++++++++

In order to look at a budget of sea-ice, we defined a rectangular lat-lon
area defined by the 28E and 35E parallels and the 81N and 82N meridians. The
area enclosed by this boundary spans 111.7 km meridionally and from 108.8 km to
122.3 km zonally. 

In addition to the corner points, 3 additional, evenly spaced grid points were
defined along each of the boundaries. Grid spacing was 27.83 meridionally and
27.20 km and 30.58 km zonally. The grid was produced with the script
*code/processing_and_data/sea_ice_drift/create_grid_box/define_box_area.py*. The
grid was stored as
*/home/oyvindl/work/atwain/data/other/sea_ice_drift/interp/ipgrid.p*.

Interpolation and computation of fluxes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

NSIDC
'''''

Interpolating NSIDC onto box boundary and computing fluxes:
*atwain/data/other/sea_ice_drift/interp/interp_NSIDC.py*.

- Rotated from native grid coordinates to *u,v* after interpolating.
- Also interpolating *u,v* onto the atwain point.
- Integrating fluxes across the boundary and computing net flux.
- Missing values (indicating no sea ice) set to 0.

Results look qualitatively similar to my previous calculation for the native
3x3 grid. 

Result is saved to **/home/oyvindl/work/atwain/data/other/sea_ice_drift/NSIDC_bound_fluxes.p**.

Ifremer
'''''''


Interpolating Ifremer onto box boundary and computing fluxes:

- Also interpolating *u,v* onto the atwain point.
- Integrating fluxes across the boundary and computing net flux.
- Missing values (indicating no sea ice) set to 0.

Comparison
''''''''''

Fairly good match between *u* and *v* (source script: *compare_u_v_atwain.py*).

    shows 31-d running mean.

    magnitudes through the boundaries (lower). Plot shows 31-d running mean.
