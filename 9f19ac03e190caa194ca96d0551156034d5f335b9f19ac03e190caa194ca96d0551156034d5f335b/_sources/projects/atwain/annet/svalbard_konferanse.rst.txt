**Interplay between atmosphere, sea ice, and oceanic heat transport over the continental
slope north of Svalbard**


The Arctic sea ice cover is shrinking, both Arctic-wide and in the European Arctic. North of Svalbard,
the ice edge retreated north and eastwards over the recent decade compared to earlier years, but
large interannual variability persists, driven by atmospheric and oceanic processes. Since 2012, a
mooring array has been monitoring the Atlantic Water inflow – the largest oceanic heat source for
the Arctic Ocean – along the continental shelf break north of Svalbard. We present analysis of the
first five years of hydrographic and current observations and corresponding developments in the
regional sea ice cover. In some years, large oceanic heat flux events in autumn and early winter
prevent local ice formation and melt sea ice that is advected into the region. Atmospheric drivers, in
particular wind-driven vertical mixing and sea ice advection, also play a major role for presence of
sea ice over the upper continental slope north of Svalbard and the longevity of the ice pack into the
summer season.
