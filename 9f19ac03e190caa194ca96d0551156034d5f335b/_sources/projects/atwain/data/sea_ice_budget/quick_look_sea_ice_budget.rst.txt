First look at the drift and sea ice area interpolated onto the *med* grid.

Trying to answer the following questions:

#. *Do the individual time series look reasonable?*
#. *Do the net flux and area cover match?*
    - *Qualitatively?*
        - E.g.: Periods of high flux in should correspond to increased SIC..
    - *Quantitatively?*
        - The time derivative of SIC should be a pretty good match to the net flux.
          In principle, any other change should be due to melting/formation..

1. Do the individual time series look reasonable?
=================================================

*Figures show daily averages and 31-day running means*.

**Area cover**

.. figure:: /files/sic_sia_medgrid_overview_timeseries.png
    :scale: 80%

- A-TWAIN point SIC is slightly lower and more variable than the domain average.
- Sea-ice covered area is proportional to average SIC (note: 
  *area weighted* average).

:math:`\rightarrow` Seems reasonable.


**Area fluxes**

.. figure:: /files/sea_ice_flux_medgrid_overview_timeseries.png
    :scale: 65%

- Net flux into domain is usually positive.
- Meridional and zonal fluxes both usually balance pretty well, and the net flux
  is usually much smaller than the fluxes through the individual boundaries.

:math:`\rightarrow` Seems reasonable.


2. Do the net flux and area cover match?
========================================

.. figure:: /files/compare_sea_ice_area_flux_medgrid_timeseries.png
    :scale: 80%


- Magnitudes are at least comparable (both datasets are pretty noisy).
  Generally, the flux amplitude is higher than d(SIC)/dt.
- There is at least *some* correspondence between the time series - and they
  agree in ice-free periods. 
- However, they flux in and area change are far from balancing each other. This
  could be due to:

  #. Methodological errors. E.g.,  something wrong in the computations, or
     perhaps it is not appropriate to directly compare these products?
  #. Actual, physical processes (melting/freezing). 

Not sure exatcly what to expect here, a priori, or how to evaluate whether this
methodology really makes sense..
