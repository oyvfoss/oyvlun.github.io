AT200 vs AT800
==============

Comparison of temperature and salinity from SBE37s on AT200 and AT800. Looking
at sensors mounted near 100 m depth (no shallower sensor on AT200 during
deployment 1, or on AT800 during deployment 2).

*A few observations:*

- Seasonal cycle has similar phase, but much higher amplitude at AT200.
- This is mainly due to a difference in the cold season (spring/summer), when
  temperatures at AT200 are typically around 2C lower than at AT800. 
- In the warm season (fall) there is little difference between the moorings.
  Previous analysis of the AT200 data has shown that the warm season is associated with
  inflowing AW.
- Warming trend in cold season temperature observed at both moorings across the three
  years.
