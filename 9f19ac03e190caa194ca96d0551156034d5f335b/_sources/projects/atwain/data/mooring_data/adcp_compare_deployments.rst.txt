Interpolation to common *dz* and *dt*
=====================================

Code: ``interpolate_deployments_for_comparison.py``

For comparison purposes, we interpolated the data from each deployment:

- First: onto evenly spaced depth grid
    - *dz = 2 m*.
    - Between 14 and 94 m depth. 
- Second: onto evenly spaced time grid.
    - *dt=(1/24/60) days=6.7 min*. 
    - Spanning the length of the deployment (after removing deployment and
      recovery).

The time series in each bin was then smoothed with a 9-point running mean to achieve
the same (hourly) resolution.

Mean currents
=============

The following figures show the depth average currents (upper: *u*, lower: *v*).
Black lines are 20 minute resolution, colored lines are 7 day running means (NB:
can give funny results for missing data).

Tides
=====

Computation of tidal fits were based on the ``seapy.tide`` module. Fits were
performed to the 11 primary constituents.

    *Major and minor amplitude and phase of each tidal constituent based on fits
    to the depth-average currents during each deployment.*

The relatively good match between the amplitude from independent fits to the current record
from each deployment is reassuring. If we assume that there is no error in the
recorded time fields, the good match in phase of the main constistuent suggests
that there is no large discrepancy in heading between the deployments.
