Joint CTD time series
#####################

.. note::

    Phe pressure field on the first deployment is farily different from that on
    the two other. Ideally, I should get a hold of the raw files here to make
    sure I'm really processing everything equally.


Want to create joint time series of ocean temperature from AT200 mooring.
Primarily interested in heat content near the surface. The following relevant data are
available (all CTDs are SBE37s):

    estimated from mean pressure and hydrostatic approximation.*

Want to generate time series from **fixed depths**. Since the sensor depths are
not fixed, I'll do this by (linear) interpolation between two surrounding
sensors.

We are interested in the water near the surface, and the two last deployments
have sensors at 46 m/50 m mean depth. The maximum depth of these sensors is 53.7
m and 62.2 m, respectively. Therefore, we choose to generate a time series at **63 m
depth**, spanning from 2013-2017.

The uppermost sensor for 2012-2013 has a mean depth of 104.6 m and a maximum depth
of 106.5 m. Therefore, we create a time series for **107 m** depth.

The following shows the workflow from raw(est) data to interpolated, joined time series:
