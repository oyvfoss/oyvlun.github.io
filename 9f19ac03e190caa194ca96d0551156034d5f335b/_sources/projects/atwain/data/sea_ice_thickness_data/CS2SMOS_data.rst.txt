CS2SMOS data
############

Downloading data
================

Downloaded all data from `this AWI ftp server
<ftp://ftpsrv2.awi.de/sea_ice/product/cryosat2_smos/v202/nh/>`_ on 08.01.2020.

Bulk download script: ``atwain/data/other/sea_ice_thickness/dl_cs2smos.sh``.  

Downloaded to ``data/other/sea_ice_thickness/ftpsrv2.awi.de`` - files sit in the
native, bulky, directory structure.

Time and averaging period
=========================

Files are **daily**, but contain **weekly averages**.

The ``time`` field shows the **central time** of the estimate (mid-day). Checked this
in ``data/other/sea_ice_thickness/define_slice_area.py`` for a single day:

:: 

 Time boundaries:
 Central time: 18.11 2010, 12:00
 Start boundary time: 15.11 2010, 00:00
 End boundary time: 22.11 2010, 00:00


Fields
======

As far as I can tell, the field ``analysis_sea_ice_thickness`` is the one I am
after. ``analysis_sea_ice_thickness_unc`` should be the uncertainty.

    Overview of variables in the daily CS2SMOS files.


Spatial subset
==============

Using a subset spanning an area covering the northern Barents Sea, Svalbard, and
extending to the pole.

Defined by the following slices:

::
    
    sl_y = slice(215, 280) # First spatial dimension
    sl_x = slice(215, 265) # Second spatial dimension

.. figure:: /files/cs2smos_sit_exampleday_subset.png
    :scale: 70%

    Map showing the subset used (contours: SIT for the whole Arctic on a specific day).


Collecting to a single file
===========================

Picking out a subslice to collect only a (wide) area of interest:
