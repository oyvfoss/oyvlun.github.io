CS2SMOS sea ice thickness product: Overview
###########################################

Choosing to look at this product since `Sallila et al 2019
<https://www.the-cryosphere.net/13/1187/2019/tc-13-1187-2019.pdf>`_  seemed
to suggest that it has the best overall performance, including over thin sea
ice. It was also recommended by Mats.

Overview
========

Nice overview of the data product `here <https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/41602/1/cs2smos_user_guide_2_1.pdf>`_ .

*(Mostly from Sallila et al 2019):*

*CS2SMOS* is a blended product of thickness estimates from CryoSat 2 and SMOS.

- Weekly data.
- 25x25 km EASE2 grid centered at (same as the NSIDC SID product? Not centered
  at 0W). 
- Available Nov 2010 to April 2017.

**SMOS**

`SMOS satellite mission
<https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/SMOS/Introducing_SMOS>`_ :
ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity. Low-Earth orbit (758 km), polar, 23-day
repeat cycle, 3-day sub-cycle. Carries a novel interferometric radiometer
that operates in the L-band microwave range (1.4 GHz - "L-band" means 1 to 2
GHz?) to capture "brightness temperature" images. According to Wikipedia, L-band
waves penetrate clouds, fog, rain, storms, and vegetation, and this band is
therefore used for GPS.

L-band brightness temperature may be used to derive SIT in areas of thin sea
ice (see `Richter et al 2018 <https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/083b/e7b997ee1b2c10dc5dd49a198a514a709fc7.pdf>`_
). L-band waves penetrates snow and sea ice for more than half a meter. L-band
estimates are useful up to 1.5 m.


**CryoSat 2**

CryoSat 2 uses radar altimetry to measure the freeboard between the snow/ice
surface and the sea surface (there are some issues with the method in fact
measuring the freeboard of the top of the snow layer instead of the ice). Sea
ice thickness is then estimated by assuming hydrostatic equillibrium. CS2 SIT
works pretty well for thick ice, and should not be used for <0.5 m. 


**Blending and processing** 

From Sallila et al 2018:

    *Due to the satellites having different spatial and temporal coverage, optimal interpolation is used to
    merge the two data sets (Ricker et al., 2017a). The algorithm
    includes weighting the data based on the known uncertainties
    of the products and modelled spatial covariances (Ricker et
    al., 2017a, b). For sea ice concentration and type, the OSISAF Arctic daily products are used. Snow depth and density
    follow the MWC. The CS2 product used is the AWI CS2
    product with processor version 1.2 (Ricker et al., 2014; Hendricks et al., 2016), and the SMOS thicknesses are from the
    University of Hamburg processor version 3.1 (Tian-Kunze et
    al., 2014; Kaleschke et al., 2016).*
