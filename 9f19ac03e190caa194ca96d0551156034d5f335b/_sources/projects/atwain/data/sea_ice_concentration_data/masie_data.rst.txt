.. warning::

    In the data I have downloaded (nc files), sea ice concentration values are
    always either 0% or 70-100%. I don't know a reason why the 1-69% would be
    suppressed. I've e-mailed NSIDC, but for now I'll use something else (Bremen
    AMSR2, probably).

Overview
========

MASIE-NH `(webpage) <https://nsidc.org/data/masie/about_masie>`_

*Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent – Northern Hemisphere*

- Daily.
- 4 x 4 km gridded.
- "Relies more on visible imagery than on passive microwave data. As a result,
  the ice edge position is generally more accurate."
- According to the `MASIE FAQ <https://nsidc.org/data/masie/masie_faq>`_, other
  products are better suited for looking at trends in sea ice cover, etc.

Looks like this product, with its high resolution and advantages near the ice
edge, is the one to use.

Crediting in image captions: *Credit: NSIDC/NIC MASIE product*.

NSIDC wants the dataset to be cited as:

    National Ice Center and National Snow and Ice Data Center. Compiled by F.
    Fetterer, M. Savoie, S. Helfrich, and P. Clemente-Colón. 2010, updated
    daily. *Multisensor Analyzed Sea Ice Extent - Northern Hemisphere (MASIE-NH),
    Version 1.* [Indicate subset used]. Boulder, Colorado USA. NSIDC: National
    Snow and Ice Data Center. doi: https://doi.org/10.7265/N5GT5K3K. [Date
    Accessed].

Trying to emulate this in the entry *nsidc_2010* to *zotbib_full*, need to make
sure it comes out right.

Processing
===========

**Downloading**

Downloaded all current data on 03.10.19 from
`ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/pub/DATASETS/NOAA/G10005/Data/
<ftp://sidads.colorado.edu/pub/DATASETS/NOAA/G10005/Data/>`_ and storing in
``~/work/atwain/data/other/sea_ice_concentration/masie/masie_dl/``. 

May want to keep this updated as new data arrives. Haven't bothered writing a
script, the following should work
 
- Modify script to include the missing files:
  ``code/processing_and_data/sea_ice_concentration/dl_masie.sh`` *(actually, may
  be just as easy to download from browser)*. 
- Files are downloaded to ``sidads.colorado.edu/.../G10005/201X/``. 
- Need to unzip (``gunzip <file.nc.gz>``) and then move to
  ``data/other/sea_ice_concentration/masie/masie_dl/``. 


**File contents**

- Monthly files.
- 07/2012 to 09/2019.
- *t, y, x* = [31, 2550, 2100]

Variables:

- **Longitude** *(y, x)*.
- **Latitude** *(y, x)*.
- **Day of Month** or **Day_of_Month** *(t)*.
- **sea ice concentration** or **sea_ice_concentration** *(t, y, x)*. 
    - 0-100=sea ice concentration [%], 110=missing, 120=land, 104=ocean out of AMSR2 bounds, 119=land out of AMSR2 bounds

**Combining and creating subset**

Subset for a large area created in ``processing_and_data/sea_ice_concentration/make_subset_masie/make_subset_masie.py.``

.. figure:: /files/masie_subset_atwain.png
    :scale: 80%

    Example day, showing extent of subset (*right:* grid coordinates, *left:*
    geographical coordinates).

Subset is stored as
``atwain/data/other/sea_ice_concentration/MASIE_subset_atwain.nc``.

**Combining and creating ATWAIN time series**


Subset for a large area created in ``processing_and_data/sea_ice_concentration/make_subset_masie/interpolate_masie_sic_onto_atwain.py``

Stored as
``atwain/data/other/sea_ice_concentration/SIC_atwain_masie.p`.
