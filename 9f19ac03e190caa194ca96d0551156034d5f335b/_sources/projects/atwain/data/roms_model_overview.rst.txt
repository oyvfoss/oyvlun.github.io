ROMS/CICE 800 m model
#####################

Overview
========

ROMS ``S800_2014`` run. See *Duarte et al (2019)* for a detailed model description.

- **1300** (:math:`\xi`) **x 1150** (:math:`\eta`) **point** horizontal grid (even **800 m** spacing).

- **35 vertical layers** (should give an average resolution of 5.7 m at 200 m depth).

- Time coverage is **01.01.2005 to 16.07.2010**.

- CICE sea ice model v5.1 with prescribed oceanic and
  atmospheric forcing. The model is 1D but rather advanced.

- Detailed freshwater fluxes
  etc. (fresh fjords..).

- Vorticity terms are computed (I think these are all
  implicitly computed).

- Model domain spans a large area around Svalbard, including the continental
  slope all the way to Frans Jozef Land, much of the Nansen Basin, and the
  northern Barents Sea:

    More detailed explanation `here <https://www.myroms.org/wiki/Vertical_S-coordinate#Vertical_Stretching_Functions>`_.

    - ``Vstretching``: **1** *(choosing the S-H94 stretching function)*.
    - ``Vtransform``: **1** *(vertical stretching parameter)*.
    - ``theta_s``: **8** *(higher values* :math:`\rightarrow` *more layers near 
      the surface)*.
    - ``theta_b``: **0.1** *(near 0* :math:`\rightarrow` *resolution focused at the
      surface, not the bottom)*.
    - ``dt``: **60** *(Size of long (baroclinic?) time steps, seconds)*.
    - ``dfast``: **1** *(Size of short (barotropic?) time steps, seconds)*.

Data
====

Files are located on shared disk */berner (?)*. Since my VM doesn't interface
very easily with the network, I've imported everything to disk
(``fenrir/data/roms_runs_norseas/S800_2014``).

Files are **daily averages**, each is about 1.5 GB.
