    **Upper:** *Time series of large-scale sea-ice drift, calculated from NSIDC
    Polar Pathfinder product (see* `this page
    <../sea_ice_drift/large_scale_flux.html>`_ *)* **Middle:** *Sea-ice concentration
    at the A-TWAIN location (U of Bremen AMSR2 product), with air temperature
    from ERA-Interim indicated in background colors (orange color is >-2C).*
    **Bottom**: *Ocean temperature from the A-TWAIN 200 m mooring.*

    *All time series have been smoothed with a 31-day running average.*

    Time series of depth-average currents, ocean heat content, density
    difference between 50 and 105 db,  sea ice concentration, and net sea ice
    drift into the area (see this). Script: ``/atwain/code/mooring_ts/q_vs_a/q_curr_other_panel.py``.
