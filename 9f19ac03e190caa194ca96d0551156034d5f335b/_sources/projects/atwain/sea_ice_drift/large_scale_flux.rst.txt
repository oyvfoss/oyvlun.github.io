Large-scale flux from the Arctic Ocean
######################################

Want to create a variable which would represent large-scale ice flux from the
interior Arctic Ocean towards the A-TWAIN location.


Choosing a line going along the native NSIDC drift grid, extending from Franz
Josef Land about halfway towards Greenland. The line is defined by the following
indices in the NSIDC drift grid (code for plotting this trajectory in
``atwain/code/sid/flux_large_transect/transects_for_si_drift_define_ind.py``).


:: 

    yind = 155
    xsl = slice(190, 209)

    Pink line: transect used to compute "Arctic flux". Red dot: AT201 mooring.
    NSIDC grid points shown as weak grey dots.

    In native NSIDC product grid (background plot is the average mask - the
    outline of Greenland is probably the easiest reference).
