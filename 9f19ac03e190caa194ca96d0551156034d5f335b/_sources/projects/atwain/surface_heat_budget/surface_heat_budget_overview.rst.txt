Surface heat budget
###################

Comparing heat flux terms from ERA-5 (interpolated onto the AT200 location) with
ocean and sea ice time series.

The following ERA5 variables are used (divided by 3600 hps to obtain the
instantaneous fluxes):
    
    - ``surface_sensible_heat_flux``
    - ``surface_latent_heat_flux``
    - ``surface_net_thermal_radiation``
    - ``surface_net_solar_radiation``

In the figure below, thin lines show dailty means, and thick lines show weekly
means.
