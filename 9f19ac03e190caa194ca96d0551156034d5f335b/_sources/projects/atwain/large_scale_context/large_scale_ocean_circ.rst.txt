Large-scale ocean circulation
#############################

ROMS-CICE 800 m runs currently only available for the period 01.01.2005 to
16.07.2010.
I may still instructive to look at the model to contextualize the ATWAIN observations.


Quick look: transect
====================

.. figure:: /files/map_transect_atwain_initial.png
    :scale: 80%

    A-TWAIN 200 location (black dot) and model transect (red).



.. figure:: /files/T_u_transect_large.png
    :scale: 80%

    Time average temperature and cross-transect velocity (grid *u*) along the transect.

    
.. figure:: /files/T_u_transect_mean_std.png
    :scale: 80%

    Time average (upper) and standard deviation (lower) of temperature and
    cross-transect velocity (grid *u*) along the transect, zommed in on the
    shallow region.
