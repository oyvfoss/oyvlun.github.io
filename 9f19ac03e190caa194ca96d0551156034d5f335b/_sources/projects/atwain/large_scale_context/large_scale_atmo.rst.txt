Large-scale atmosphere
######################

Interested in whether the main driver of sea-ice concentration near the A-TWAIN
mooring is large-scale atmospherice forcing.

Doing some preliminary analysis of the large-scale atmosphere based on a subset
of ERA-Interim. Experimenting with using the python *eofs* module, which seems
very promising. 

At each point, EOFs are weighted with the square root of the cosine of latitude.

*Note: Check that the data is provided on an equal lat/lon grid - if not, this
probably doesn't make sense*.

Ideas
=====

- Look at time series in relation to A-TWAIN SIC.
- Look at structure of correlation (lagged) between local/regional SIC and large
  spatial fields.
- EOF analysis of all ERA fields.
- Try removing the seasonal cycle before computing the modes?
