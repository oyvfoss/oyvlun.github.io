Overview
========

ROMS ``S800_2014`` run.

- **1300** (:math:`\xi`) **x 1150** (:math:`\eta`) **point** horizontal grid (even **800 m** spacing).

- **35 vertical layers** (should give an average resolution of 5.7 m at 200 m depth).

- Time coverage is **01.01.2005 to 16.07.2010**.

- Looks like the model includes rather advances sea ice modelling and freshwater fluxes
  etc. (fresh fjords..).

- Mixing quantities are exported, as are vorticity terms (I think these are all
  implicitly computed).

- Model domain spans a large area around Svalbard, including the continental
  slope all the way to Frans Jozef Land, much of the Nansen Basin, and the
  northern Barents Sea:

.. admonition:: Parameter values

    - ``Vstretching``: **1** *(vertical stretching parameter?)*
    - ``Vtransform``: **1** *(vertical stretching parameter?)*
    - ``theta_s``: **8** *(vertical stretching parameter?)*
    - ``theta_b``: **0.1** *(vertical stretching parameter?)*
    - ``dt``: **60** *(Size of long (baroclinic?) time steps, seconds)*
    - ``dfast``: **1** *(Size of short (barotropic?) time steps, seconds)*

Data
====

Files are located on shared disk */berner (?)*. Since my VM doesn't interface
very easily with the network, I've imported everything to disk
(``fenrir/data/roms_runs_norseas/S800_2014``).

Files are **daily averages**, each is about 1.5 GB.

Quick look: transect
====================

.. figure:: /files/map_transect_atwain_initial.png
    :scale: 80%

    A-TWAIN 200 location (black dot) and model transect (red).



.. figure:: /files/T_u_transect_large.png
    :scale: 80%

    Time average temperature and cross-transect velocity (grid *u*) along the transect.

    
.. figure:: /files/T_u_transect_mean_std.png
    :scale: 80%

    Time average (upper) and standard deviation (lower) of temperature and
    cross-transect velocity (grid *u*) along the transect, zommed in on the
    shallow region.
