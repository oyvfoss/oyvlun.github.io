Sea ice along the 200 m contour
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

Interested in sea ice cover along the 200 m bathy contour north of Svalbard.

Using the *Near-Real-Time DMSP SSM/I-SSMIS Daily Polar
Gridded Sea Ice Concentrations* (daily, 25 km x 25 km).

Path
''''

Handpicking a number of points (roughly) along the 200 m isobath
(*pick_points_200m.py*) based on ETOPO1 bathymetry. Saved in (200m_points.p*):

     Path points (red) plotted on ETOPO1 bathymetry. ATWAIN mooring location
     (second deployment) in green ring.

There are 24 points spanning a distance of 720 km from west of Albert I Land on
Spitsbergen to north of Franz Josef Land. Average spacing between points is 34.8
km, giving a total path distance of 799 km. 


Subset
''''''

Due its large , it was difficult to work directly with the full dataset, either
locally or remotely. Therefore, an nc-file containing a 20 x 30 point subset
spanning the area was generated. In addition, data before 2011 was removed. The
resulting subset file is stored in
*atwain/data/other/sea_ice_concentration/NSIDC_subset_atwain.nc*.

     Left: Full SIC product coverage (left) and span of subset (right). SEC
     field from 01.01.2012.


Bilinear interpolation of the (2011-) SIC field onto the point was done (using
*xesmf.Regridder*). Code in *interpolate_sic_onto_path.p*. 


Interpolation
'''''''''''''

This subset was then interpolated onto the 24-point path (bilinear
interpolation using *xesmf.Regridder*. The resulting data is stored as a Bunch
in */home/oyvindl/work/atwain/data/other/sea_ice_concentration/SIC_200m_path.p*.
