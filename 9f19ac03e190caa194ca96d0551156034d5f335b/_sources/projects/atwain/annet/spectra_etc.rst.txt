Spectra, etc
############


.. figure:: /files/spectrogram_10d_windows_rot.png
    :scale: 80

    Spectrogram of the rotary components of velocity. Depth avergaged spectra
    computed from FFTs of complex velocity over 10-day windows overlapping by
    50%.

    :scale: 80

    Bottom: Time evolution of power spectral density in the $\sim$0.5 cpd band.
    Also shown are sea ice concentration (top) and wind speed (middle).


Shear
=====

.. figure:: /files/mean_spec_10d_windows_rot_shear.png
    :scale: 80

    Average rotary spectra of vertical shear. Computed from FFT performed over
    10-day windows.

    :scale: 80

    Spectrogram of the rotary components of vertical shear. Depth avergaged spectra
    computed from FFTs of complex shear over 10-day windows overlapping by
    50%.



.. figure:: /files/m2_band_ts_cw_ccw_shear.png
    :scale: 80

    Bottom: Time evolution of power spectral density in the semi-diurnal ($\sim$2 cpd) band.
    Also shown are sea ice concentration (top) and density difference between 50
    and 105 db (middle).
