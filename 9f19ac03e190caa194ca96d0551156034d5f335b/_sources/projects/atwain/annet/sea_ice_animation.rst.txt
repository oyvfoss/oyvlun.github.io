Sea ice animation
=================

Quantities shown are:

- SIC from NSIDC. Also plotted on the map are the 500 m bathymetric contour
  from ETOPO1 (red dashed lines), the A-TWAIN mooring location (red cross), and
  the 50% SIC contour (orange line).
- Time series (daily and 31d LPFed) of SIC (NSIDC) and air temperature (ERA Interim) at the A-TWAIN
  mooring location.
- Time series (daily and 31d LPFed) of (approximate) ocean heat content between 55 and 100 m depth
  from the mooring record.
- Sea ice drift vector at the A-TWAIN
  mooring location (daily and 31d LPFed) (Ifremer product).
- Wind vector at the A-TWAIN
  mooring location (daily and 31d LPFed) (ERA Interim).
