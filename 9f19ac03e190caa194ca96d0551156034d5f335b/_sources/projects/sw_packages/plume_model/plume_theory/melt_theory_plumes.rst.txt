Understanding the melt equations
################################

The melt equations come from considering the thermodynamic conditions at the
glacier-ocean interface.

We assume that there is a thin interface layer between the glacier and the ocean
where the water is in thermodynamic equillibrium with the ice. *(Note: do we also
assume that this layer is of constant thickness?)*:

The first governing equation comes from the assumption that the interface layer
is in thermodynamic equillibrium, i.e. it is at freezing temperature. We get the
freezing temperature from an approcimation of the freezing temperature as
linearly dependent on the salinity and depth ; :math:`T_f(S, z) = \lambda_1 S +
\lambda_2 + \lambda_3 z`, which I like to write :math:`T_f = \lambda_1 S +
\beta`.

For the interface we get:

Next, we consider the *salinity budget* for the interface layer. The
contributors are exchange with the ice through melting/freezing, and with the
(plume) water through turbulent exchange:

The *heat budget* for the interface layer is similar, but we also have to
consider the heat loss that goes into generating the melt, so we get an extra term.

These three equations comprise the melt equations in the plume.
