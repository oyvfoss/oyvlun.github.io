TSG data from Kronprins Haakon
###############################

Received full time series processed from Ylva. Includes a quality flag system
(1: good, 0: bad) based on a number of tests.

*Variables:*

- ``SSC`` - TSG conductivity
- ``SSJT`` - TSG temperature
- ``SSPS`` - TSG salinity
- ``SSTP`` - Intake temperature

Also lat, lon, time, flags, intake depth, etc.

*Recommended flags:*

    - ``QF_time`` - flags duplicates.
    - ``QF_san`` - flags data collected during freshwater flushing
      maintenance.
    - ``QF_dT`` - flags instances wheredifference between SSTP and SSJT too high (accounts for lag).
    - ``QF_h2o`` - flags instances with low water flow (e.g. during ice clogging
      the system), as well as 10 min before and 45 min after such instances.
