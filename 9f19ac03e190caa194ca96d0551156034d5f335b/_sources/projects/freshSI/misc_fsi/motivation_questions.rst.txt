Background and research questions
#################################

- Ocean-ice-atmosphere interactions in the Arctic (and elsewhere!) are highly
  dependent on the upper surface layer. 
    - Also: Critical for biology, carbonate chemistry etc.
- Is there a characteristic scale away from the sea ice edge where freshening occurs?
- Is there a difference between receding and advancing sea ice cover? 

*Barents Sea specific:*

- What governs variability 
    - Sea ice advection?
    - Sea ice melt cycle timing?
    - Wind influence?
