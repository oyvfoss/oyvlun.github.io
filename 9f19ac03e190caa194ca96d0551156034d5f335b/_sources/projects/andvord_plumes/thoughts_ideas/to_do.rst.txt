To do
######

- **Validate plume model implementation.**
    - Need to make sure the model does what it is supposed to.
    - Did some of this earlier - looks good, but gettign some (minor
      discrepancies vs Matlab implememntation).
      - Need to make sure I understand what is going on.

- **Make completely sure I understand whether to use potential or in-situ
  temperature**
    - Look at my notes from somewhere in the logbook - I've been over this before. 

- **Consider reprocessing CTD data?**
    - Maybe use improved SB routines?

- **Find terminus positions**
   - Need to know exactly how far from the terminus these measurements were collected!
    - Previous e-mails with Jack?
    - Amanda's submitted paper?
   - May have to go with the *closest position in time*, or a linear average of
     the two closest ones?

- **Look around in Quantarctica at tidal flexing, etc?**
    - Can I obtain some basic parameters that may be of interest?

- **Read and reacquaint with relevant papers**
    - My fjordeco papers.
    - Emily.
    - Lisa and Kiefer.
    - Jack.
    - RACMO papers (van Wessem).
    - Vaughan runoff paper.

- **Finish and publish plume code**
    - I think things should be running ok now?
    - The following need to be done before publishing:
        - Check integrety (see above)
        - Remove any internal dependencies.
        - Check ease-of-use.
        - Fix documentation.
    - Git publishing:
        - Create a separate git user for code projects.
            - Want to keep separate from the project website..
