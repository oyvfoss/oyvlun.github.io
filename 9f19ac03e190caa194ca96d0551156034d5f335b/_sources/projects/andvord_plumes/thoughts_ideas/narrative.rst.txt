Narrative
##########

Motivation
===========

- WAP is special compared to other glacial fjords in that runoff is very small.
- We know next to nothing about glacier-ocean interactions, except that they are
  very important to sediment and iron fluxes and biology. 
- Like in Greenland, there is a deep-water heat source in the form of mUCDW - 
  and this appears to drive glacial retreat along the WAP.
- Both the atmosphere and the ocean are changing - we are interested in how this
  may change g-o interactions in the future.

Observations
==============
**Plumes**

- Plumes observed in Andvord Bay during three separate field campaigns.
- Source appears to be consistently at the same location.
- Spreading downfjord, dissapating with distance.

**Origin of plumes derived from T-S properties**

- Examine T-S properties from near-glacier plumes (glider transect).
- Compare with output from plume model.
    - Trying both line and cone, and various parameters. 
    - :math:`\rightarrow` **Meltwater source (!)**

**Sensitivity experiments**

- Sensitivity to deep water temperature.
    - Using an ideal profile together with existing parameters, "heat up" the
      deepwater and see whether melting/fluxes increase. 
    - **NOTE**: Is there also a *density difference* between BSW/mUCDW that would
      make a difference? 
- Evaluating for WAP fjords?
    - Holding everything else equal and forcing with profiles from WAP model?
    - **NOTE** perhaps a difficult exercise - would have to scale with the
      geometry somehow?
    - **Or** can we use a dimensionalised scaling somehow? Maybe a smart choice
      of diagnostic parameters could make this possible?
- Sensitivity to subglacial runoff.
    - *What happens if we start to get subglacial freshwater runoff?*
    - Introduce subglacial FW flux and see what happens.
        - Do the plumes reach the surface?
        - Do they quickly out-compete the present-day plumes?



**Known unknowns: Need for observations**

- Need to constrain the fluxes.
- Need to know more about terminus geometry.

Points of discussion
====================

**Origin of observed mid-water intrusions**

(Combining and shortening 4.1 and 4.2. from present manuscript).

- TS properties consistent with meltwater source.
- Speculation: Maybe overhang/melt?
- Key: Otherwise silent system?
- Frequqncy connected to caling events etc?

**Lessons from buoyant plume theory**
(Base on 4.3 from present manuscript).

- Specific to the Bagshawe experiments.

**Implications for physical and geochemical fluxes**

**Potential effects of ocean warming and/or increased subglacial runoff**


NOTES
=====

- What about geothermal melt?
