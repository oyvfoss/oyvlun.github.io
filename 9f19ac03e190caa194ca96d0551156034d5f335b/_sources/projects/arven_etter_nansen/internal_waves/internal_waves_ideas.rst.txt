Quick outline for internal waves project
###########################################


Motivation
===========
- Stratification extremely important for biology, heat transports and sea ice in
  the future Arctic.
- In general, we *do not know* whether the Arctic Ocean will be more or less
  stratified in the future.
- Wind stress will be more intense in an ice covered ocean. 
- Storm tracks:
    - Will move further north?
    - Will intensify in strength but not frequency?

Do

**Data**

Make single files for each mooring containing:

- U, V *(2D)*
- SHU, SHV *(2D)*
- Wind U, Wind V (*1D*)
- WS U, WS V *(1D)*
- SIC *(1D)*
- LON, LAT *(0D)*

Get tide time series (on same grid!) from Padman model..

- Add uv tide time series of tidal prediction.

Get a metric for the Run slab model? (Or just do complex demodulation on the winds?)

- "Inertial input amplitude" (1D)

**Read**

- Alford NI summary paper: Read the Arctic part.
- Clarify which rotational direction implies upward propagation.

**Analysis**

- 



**Plots**


#. U/V/SHU/SHV panels for all moorings.

#. - Demodulated shear amplitude
   - Wind input
   - Sea ice concentration

**Expanding**

*If* we can find somewhat of a connection between shear energy and wind energy
input:
    - *Use ERA winds , or maybe CMIP6 winds/sea ice, to evaluate wind stress input across the Arctic in a future
      scenario or something?* 

*If there are vertical gradients: Can we see anything changing in the upper
sensors?*
