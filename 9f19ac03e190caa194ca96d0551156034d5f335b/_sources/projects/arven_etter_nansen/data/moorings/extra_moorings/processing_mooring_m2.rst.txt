Processing, M2
==============



.. warning:: 

    Processing is **preliminary**! 

    Need to:

    - Do thorough checking.
    - To reprocess with new calibration constants. 
    - Should probably also do more thorough salinity editing -
      pretty ad hoc right now. 
    - Do systematic comparisons with CTD profiles.






RBR CTDs
--------

Code and data in ``work/arven_etter_nansen/data/moorings/m2/processed/ctd``.

- ``process_ctds_m2_concertos.py``: 
    - Read all Concerto sensors.
    - Do some very quick salinity editing.
    - Calculate density and potential temperature from T and S. 
    - Interpolate onto very high-frequency time array, low-pass with a daily
      filter and subsample to daily resolution.
        - :math:`\rightarrow` Arrays with time series for each sensors:
          ``m2_concertos_full.p``.
    - Interpolate onto common depth grid as well.
        - :math:`\rightarrow` ``m2_concertos_full_interp.p``.

- ``process_ctds_m2_all.py``:
    - Similar, but now including both Solo and Concerto sensors. 
    - Solo are temperature only - estimating depth from mooring diagram,
      interpolating between Concerto sensors.

      - :math:`\rightarrow` ``m2_all_temp_interp.p``

ADCP
----

Code and data in
``work/arven_etter_nansen/data/moorings/m2/processed/adcp/``.

- ``process_adcp_m2.py``:
    - Going through standard processing steps using my ``oyv.data.rdi_adcp``
      module.
    - This includes threshold masking with standard parameters, and direction
      correction for magnetic declination.
    - Also calculates shear.

      - ``m2_adcp_processed_v1.p``.


Signature 500 ADCP
------------------

Code and data in
``work/arven_etter_nansen/data/moorings/m2/processed/signature_500/``.

``read_and_combine_avg_signature500_m2.py``:

- Read signature 500 .mat files from the M2 mooring.
- Compute bin depth based on pressure record.
- Grab revelant fields including u, v, w, beam correlation, amplitude.
- Compute shear from first difference of every second beam (since cell extent overlaps
  by 50%)
- Sort chronologically and combine into arrays spanning the entire deployment.
- Saving to ``m2_signature_avg_combined_unprocessed.p``.

*Note: NO MASKING OR QUALITY CONTROL done here. The whole depth range is included,
including above-surface bins.*
