Processing, M3
==============



.. warning:: 

    Processing is **preliminary**! 

    Need to:

    - Do thorough checking.
    - Rethink my processing of seabird (should use ``oyv.data.read_cnv``?).





Seabird CTD
------------

Code and data in ``work/arven_etter_nansen/data/moorings/m3/processed/seabird/``.

- ``grab_seabird_m3.py``: Very ad-hoc processing, seems to work fine.
  - :math:`\rightarrow` ``seabird_M3_v1.p``

ADCP
----

Code and data in
``work/arven_etter_nansen/data/moorings/m3/processed/adcp/``.

- ``process_adcp_m3.py``:
    - Going through standard processing steps using my ``oyv.data.rdi_adcp``
      module.
    - This includes threshold masking with standard parameters, and direction
      correction for magnetic declination.
    - Also calculates shear.

      - ``m3_adcp_processed_v1.p``.
