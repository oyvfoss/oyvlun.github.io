    *Velocity from the RDI 150 kHz ADCP on the M3 mooring. Arrows show depth
    average current vectors (weekly average). Contour plots show velocity
    component (filtered in timw with a 7-d running mean). Upper panel shows
    local SIC from UoB AMSR2.*

    *Vertical current shear from the RDI 150 kHz ADCP on the M3 mooring,
    computed from first differencing of the velocity components. Averaged in
    time with a 3-day running mean. Upper panel shows local SIC from UoB AMSR2.*
