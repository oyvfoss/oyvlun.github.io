    *Time series of air temperature, sea level pressure, mean wind speed,
    maximum wind speed and wind direction at the mooring sites. Thin lines show
    daily means, thick lines show weekly means.* (Note: Using 25hr and (24*7+1)
    hr windowing for some of these, since ``runstats`` requires an even window..).
