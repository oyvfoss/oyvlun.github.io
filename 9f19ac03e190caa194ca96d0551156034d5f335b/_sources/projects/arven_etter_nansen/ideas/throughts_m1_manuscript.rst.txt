Thoughts about the M1 manuscript
================================


Sources
-------

**Hydrography**
- Want to show M1 data: 
    - Seasonal cycle in heat and currents.
    - Sea ice cover.
    - Evolution of the stratification (deepeing of ML..).

**Inflow**
    - In addition to M1 data, I may be able to use:
        - Kvitøyrenna CTD transects.
        - AT200 data.

Questions/themes
----------------

*What governs the inflow of AW into the Barents Sea from the North?*

- Have seasonal variability in currents and heat - where does it come from?
- Look at large-scale time series of wind forcing and ice..
- Look at the M1 and M2 mooring together.



Data
----

*ADCPs*
+++++++

- I think my processing here is pretty good.
- Need to make *sure* magnetic declination has not already been applied.

*T/S sensors*
+++++++++++++
- So far: Using pre-cal coefficients - my understanding is that new ones are on
  the way. 
  - Fine to go forward with what I have now, but should make everything flexible
    enough to easily replace with updated calibration.
- Interpolation in depth: I think I've already done this reasonably well, but I
  think there was a mismatch in nominal depth, or something?

*External* 
++++++++++

- **Sea ice concentration**: I think I'll just keep using Bremen AMSR2.
- **Large-scale atmosphere**:
    - Not sure what the overning variable would be here.
        - Large-scale winds?
        - Large-scale wind stress curl?

*CTDs* 
++++++++++

- Need for validating the mooring datasets.
- May also like to use Kvitøyrenna transects.

Data:
- Need to do the thorough processing here - or will IMR do it?


*LADCP/SADCP* 
+++++++++++++

Both *should* be available- and I can process LADCP if I have good SADCP.
However, there are awkward gaps in the SADCP data and IMR techs don't seem very
interested in helping, so I might be stuck.
